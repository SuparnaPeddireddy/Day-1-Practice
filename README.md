# Day 1 Practice — Data Science Journey

This repository contains my Day 1 practice work as part of my transition into Data Science. I practiced working with **Python, Excel, Power BI, and SQL**, and completed a small data analysis project.

---

## ✅ What I Practiced

### Excel (`insurance.xlsx`)
- Total and average calculations
- Conditional columns (High/Low Cost)
- Filtering and counts on customer attributes

---

### Power BI (`insurance.xlsx`)
- Imported data and created:
  - Bar chart of charges by region
  - Pie chart of smoker distribution
  - Table of average BMI by gender
  - Slicer for filtering by number of children

---

### SQL (`employees.csv`)
- Basic SELECT queries
- Filtering by department and salary
- Distinct values
- Pattern matching on names
- Combined filters on manager and department

---

### Python
- Loops and list operations
- Mini data analysis project:
  - Loaded `employees.csv`
  - Calculated average salary
  - Filtered by department
  - Bar chart of employee counts

---

## ✅ Files Included

- Jupyter notebook:
  - `Day_1_Practise_List&Loops_employees_analysis.ipynb`
- Data files:
  - `employees.csv`
  - `insurance.xlsx`
  - `insurance_practise.xlsx`
- SQL script:
  - `employees_practice.sql`
